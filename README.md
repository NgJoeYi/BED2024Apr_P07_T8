# BED2024Apr_P07_T8

## bisque is default colour

### Version Control: 
The team leader should create a remote GitHub repository named BED2024Apr_P<x>_T<y>, where <x> is your tutorial group number and <y> is your assignment team number or name. Give everyone in your group and your tutor collaborator rights.
### Collaboration with Git: 
All members should clone the remote repository from Visual Studio Code. During development, regularly pull the latest changes from the repository to see updates from others. Whenever you're done working on a part of your features, push your completed code to the repository for everyone to access. This way, everyone stays on the same page and can build upon each other's work. Try experimenting with Git branches and Github Pull Requests!
### Database Creation: 
Work together to finalize the SQL script to create all the tables needed for your assignment and populate them with appropriate data. Each member should run the script on their local SQL Server to create the database you'll use for coding.
### Communication: Use the GitHub repository and MS Teams to share information and files related to the assignment.
Back Up Your Work: Always back up your code and keep different versions on an external or cloud storage. Remember, while version control helps, it's good practice to have a personal backup in case of unexpected issues.


# Checkpoint 2 (10%, Due in Week 11)
At this stage, you should have partially completed the proposed functions.

## Deliverables:
### An assignment cover page indicating the Student ID and name of each
student in the team, with the individual functions completed at this stage, as
well as the link to GitHub repository which contains the source code. (Note:
You should have done at least one GET function and one
POST/PUT/DELETE function at this stage.)
### Individual video (not exceeding 5 minutes) from each student demonstrating
functions completed or errors encountered (if the function done failed) at this
stage.
### Back-end application source code and media files from all team members
placed in appropriate sub-folders.
### Database script and environment files for creation of a database that supports
the back-end application, sample data should be provided in those files.
(Note: Compress the above files as one zipped file and submit this zipped file to
POLITEMall.)

# Checkpoint 3 (80%, Due in Week 15)
This is the final submission; you should have completed all functions and pages
proposed during Checkpoint 1 submission. Deliverables (compress the following
files as one zipped file and submit this file to POLITEMall):
